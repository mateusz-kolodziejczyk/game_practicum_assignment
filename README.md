# Desolate
A first person shooter coded in Unity over 3 months for a college class.
#### Implemented Features:
- Three fully working weapons: Pistol, Shotgun and Machine gun using real projectiles.
- Level generation using an image file.
- Basic enemy behaviour(follow and shoot) that uses sight lines.
- Animation that matches the behaviour ingame(attack speed modifies animation speed of enemies).
- A dynamic difficulty system that includes changing difficulty based on recent events as well as over the entire game. This is done by changing enemy attack speed/damage based on how well the player is doing.
- 4 levels.
